At aampe, our analytics and insights are designed to empower businesses with real-time, user-level data that goes beyond traditional campaign performance. You'll be able to track granular user behavior, measure incremental impact, and gain valuable insights that fuel growth. Our analytics is built to do two things:

- **Fuel Agent Learning** — helping each agent get smarter about what works and for whom.
- **Support Human Insight** — giving your teams real-time views into content, performance, and user response.

These analytics don't just sit in a dashboard — they're also used by your agents to continuously learn what to send, to whom, and when. By tracking label-level and timing performance, agents refine their hypotheses and improve message selection with every interaction.

## What's Possible

Beyond what's available in the product today, Aampe supports a flexible analytics infrastructure that can be customized to answer deeper performance questions. Below are the core analytics we support — many of which power internal dashboards or learning loops already used by our partners.

### Incrementality and Contribution Metrics

Tracks how much each interaction contributes to user engagement, isolating the impact of campaigns from organic behavior. This provides a high-level view of campaign effectiveness and ROI.

### Cumulative Impact Analysis

Measures the combined effects of messages and surfaces, highlighting cross-channel interactions to understand how various touchpoints drive user actions (e.g., purchases, bookings, etc.).

### Baseline Comparison, Control Groups & Flexible Attribution

Track aampe-powered messages with global holdout groups for baseline comparison. Customizable attribution windows enable tailored measurement of engagement and success based on your specific business goals.

### Custom Analytics & Data Export

Visualize and export key metrics (CTR, conversions, message efficacy) at both macro and user levels. Track performance over time, easily integrating with tools like BigQuery or Tableau.

- Custom analytics export enables comparison across messages and labels.
- User profile export with label scores allows you to dive deeper into individual user behavior.

## What's In Place

The dashboards below are built not just for tracking — but for action. They help you answer core questions like:

- What kinds of messages resonate with different users?
- Are we testing enough content variety to learn from?
- What's leading to clicks, conversions, or churn?

Each section supports certain decisions — whether refining copy, pacing messages, or spotting winning content themes early.

### Analytics Hub

A central dashboard providing an overview of all your messaging analytics and key performance indicators.

### Messages Sent

Use this page to monitor how many of which message(s) are being sent to which groups of your users over time. Key insights you can get from this page include messaging interests/trends and how this varies by audience, etc. This page allows you to answer questions like:

- How many messages are being sent everyday for each channel?
- What percentage of messages are benefiting from agentic learning?
- How many messages are being sent to New users vs Active users?
