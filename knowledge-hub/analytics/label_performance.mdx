## Label Management

### Label Overview

The Label Overview provides insights into which macro trends are currently resonating with your users. It tracks the performance of your labels (e.g., affordability, convenience) and helps you optimize your content strategy.

- Identify which labels are driving higher engagement or revenue success.
- View the total content volume for each label, ensuring you have enough variant coverage.
- Easily explore the best-performing message variants associated with each label by clicking on it.

It's not enough just to know what's performing well; we want to understand why it's performing well.

- Click on any label to see all your alternates and how each one performs on a copy level.
- Identify top-performing and underperforming labels/alternates to understand user engagement. Explore variant effectiveness within each label to pinpoint successful messaging for higher engagement or conversions.

### Content Personalisation Map

Easily compare your offerings and value propositions to ensure you have variants that talk about each of your offerings in a way that appeals to each of your users.

- Ensure you're representing each offering with a healthy mix of value propositions that appeal to different user motivations.
- Choose any two content components for the X and Y axes (e.g., greetings vs CTAs, incentives vs offerings) to fit the content strategy you're reviewing.

This helps you build-out your content catalog, avoid over-indexing on certain pairings, and guide creation where it matters most.
