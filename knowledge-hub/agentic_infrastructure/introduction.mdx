## What is aampe?

Aampe is an agentic infrastructure—where every user gets an AI agent that adapts messaging based on real-time behaviors. This means:

- **Autonomous Decision-Making** – No more static rule-based campaigns.
- **Continuous Learning** – AI agents evolve with each interaction.
- **Scalable Personalization** – Millions of users, each with a unique experience.

## How does aampe work?

Aampe assigns an individual AI agent to each user to learn their behaviors and preferences based on the data shared with aampe. The AI agent then optimizes the content, timing, frequency, and channel to communicate with the user.

> Each user gets their own AI agent that learns and adapts to their unique behaviors and preferences.

The AI agents learn from user interactions (events) to continuously improve the messaging or surface content and personalize the user experience.

Labels are used to categorize and describe various components of a message, such as tone, value proposition, or call to action. They guide the agents in understanding which types of message components resonate with users.

### Content Distribution

Content can be delivered through triggered messages or via API endpoints for surface personalization.

Content distribution can happen by triggering the messages and allowing the agents to optimize send time and frequency in addition to content. Another option is to call the Aampe API endpoint and retrieve the content to add it to any surface you want to personalize.

## How does aampe integrate with my existing tech stack?

Aampe integrates with existing push providers, communication gateways, and data platforms to access user data and send communications.

We ingest your first-party events data to feed our models and store this data in your preferred geographical GCP region. Your data is always separated from other customer's data. It does not store any PII data. Data can also be exported to your data warehouse.

Aampe also has a recommender system that can deliver personalized product recommendations in push notifications and surfaces. [Read more about the aampe product recommender here](https://aampe-knowledgehub.vercel.app/agentic-infrastructure#).

## Do I have access to the learnings and results?

The data aampe generates is yours. Aampe provides full visibility for message click rate, general engagement, intent, and conversion level. Customers are able to drill down to metrics into each message and each variant of the message within the platform.
