While waiting, you can see the numbers updating on the live performance page. Here are the definitions:

## Unique messages live

**What it means:**\
The number of unique messages you have deployed. This number considers all the alternates you have as part of a message.

## Event-stream record analyzed

**What it means:**\
Event stream records are detailed logs of user actions and interactions with your app. These can include clicks, purchases, logins, and other activities that aampe receives from your data source.

**Why it's important:**\
By analyzing these records, aampe gains insights into how users interact with your app. This helps optimize the timing and content of messages based on actual user behavior, ensuring messages are sent at the most opportune moments and with the most relevant content.

## Major clusters analyzed

**What it means:**\
Data clusters represent patterns of events that tend to occur close to each other in time, which correspond to different types of user behavior. One example might be events related to browsing; another might be events related to progressing through a market research survey.) We can use these patterns to characterize the many unique needs and preferences of our user population.

**Why it's important:**\
By identifying and analyzing these clusters, Aampe can tailor messages more precisely to each user. This ensures that users receive relevant and engaging content, ultimately enhancing their experience and increasing the likelihood of desired actions, such as making a purchase or returning to the app.

## Messages scheduled

**What it means:**\
After analyzing and clustering, your agents know what is a good time and content to send to your users. They will now schedule the messages ahead for the next few days. When you just start messaging and you look into the message scheduler, you can see that the distribution will be pretty even during the learning period. After that, the time to send messages changes daily.

## Messages sent

**What it means:**\
This is the number of messages that have been sent. Now it shouldn't take too long anymore until all the data is processed and you can see the live performance of each message launched.

## Agents Learning: Timing

### When is the best time to send a message?

There's no universal answer to this question—and that's exactly the problem with traditional messaging strategies. Most tools guess a single send time and apply it to everyone, regardless of personal habits, preferences, or context.

But your users aren't all the same. Their routines, schedules, and responsiveness vary widely. That's why guessing a send time—like 4 p.m. for a dinner promotion—leaves a lot of opportunity on the table.

### Why Guessing Fails: The Dinner Dilemma

Let's take a common use case: sending a message about ordering dinner.

The obvious guess might be 4 or 5 p.m. Just before dinnertime. But what about users who:

- Work night shifts and eat at midnight?
- Make dinner plans early in the morning?
- Eat at inconsistent times during the week?

A fixed send time misses all of these users.

### How Your Agents Personalizes Timing

At Aampe, timing is not guessed, it's learned.

Your agents track each user's behavior over time by observing how they respond to the messages they receive. This helps build an individual timing preference profile for every user in your system.

When your agents select a message to send, they also choose the time that's most likely to result in a meaningful user action—based on that user's past engagement patterns.

This happens automatically and continuously, without the need for manual time-slot management.

### Where to See Timing Optimization in Action

Visit your Monitoring page and navigate to the Timing & Frequency section.

There, you'll find:

- A breakdown of message delivery by time window
- Engagement insights by time of day
- A global view of your users' timing preferences, based on real behavior

This data gives you a deeper understanding of when your users are most receptive, across your entire user base.
