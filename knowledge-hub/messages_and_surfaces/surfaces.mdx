## Creating Your First Surface

Let's walk through setting up your first Surface in Composer:

![Surface Setup Pn](/images/surface_setup.png)

1. Navigate to the Surfaces section and click "Create Surface"
2. Choose a descriptive name (like "Banner"), add an optional description, and apply relevant tags
3. Set up Frequency Guardrails to control how often content is displayed to users

## Designing Your Template

![Template Pn](/images/template.png)

The Template defines the structure of your API response. Each Element you add becomes a property in the returned JSON. For example:

```
{  
  "headline": "some text generated for the surface",  
  "body": "some more text generated for the surface"  
}
```

We offer several pre-defined element types to get you started. Most elements return a simple string, while special types like Buttons provide structured data:

```
{  
  "callToActionButton": {  
    "label": "Click me!",  
    "action": "deeplink://link-to-something"  
  }  
}
```

> **Pro tip:**

> Each Element has a human-readable name that helps you identify fields in the editor â€“ this won't affect your API response.

Similar to Push Messages, Surface Messages can be targeted to specific Audiences. When a user requests content, our intelligent Aampe Agents select the most appropriate Message based on:

- The user's matching Audiences
- The specific Surface being requested
- Current content optimization parameters

### Crafting Your Content

The Message Editor will feel familiar if you've used Composer before. Each section corresponds to a Template Element, and you can populate them using:
