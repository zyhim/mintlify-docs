Welcome to Aampe's Surfaces feature - a powerful tool that lets you create personalized, dynamic content for every user of your app. Whether you're looking to customize banners, buttons, carousels, or text content, Surfaces makes it simple to deliver the right message to the right user at the right time.

## Creating your first surface

Let's walk through setting up your first Surface in Composer:

![Surface Setup Pn](/images/surface_setup.png)

1. Navigate to the Surfaces section and click "Create Surface"
2. Choose a descriptive name (like "Banner"), add an optional description, and apply relevant tags
3. Set up Frequency Guardrails to control how often content is displayed to users

## Designing your template

![Template Pn](/images/template.png)

The Template defines the structure of your API response. Each Element you add becomes a property in the returned JSON. For example:

```
{  
  "headline": "some text generated for the surface",  
  "body": "some more text generated for the surface"  
}
```

We offer several pre-defined element types to get you started. Most elements return a simple string, while special types like Buttons provide structured data:

```
{  
  "callToActionButton": {  
    "label": "Click me!",  
    "action": "deeplink://link-to-something"  
  }  
}
```

> **Pro tip:**
>
> Each Element has a human-readable name that helps you identify fields in the editor â€“ this won't affect your API response.

## Creating dynamic messages

Similar to Push Messages, Surface Messages can be targeted to specific Audiences. When a user requests content, our intelligent Aampe Agents select the most appropriate Message based on:

- The user's matching Audiences
- The specific Surface being requested
- Current content optimization parameters

### Crafting your content

The Message Editor will feel familiar if you've used Composer before. Each section corresponds to a Template Element, and you can populate them using:

![Message Content Web](/images/message_content.webp)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Static text">
    Enter fixed content for all users
  </Card>
  <Card title="Components">
    Reuse pieces across multiple messages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Datasets">
    Dynamic data selection based on rules
  </Card>
  <Card title="CMS Data">
    Pull content from your CMS
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Going Live

<Info>
  **Remember:**

  Only Live Messages are used to generate Surface content - Drafts remain inactive.

## Implementation Guide

Once your Message is live, the Review screen provides everything you need to integrate with the Content API. Note that content is cached for up to 24 hours for each Surface-User combination, so repeated calls to the API with the same parameters will result in the same content being returned.

### API Implementation

You can find detailed API documentation at [Surface API](https://docs.aampe.com/reference)

<Info>
  API content is updated every 24 hours. The API returns a list of surfaces, so a single API call can be used to personalize several parts of your app or website.
