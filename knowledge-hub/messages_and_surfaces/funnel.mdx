To help your agents learn what matters most to your business, you'll need to identify and classify your key events.

### Step 1: Import Relevant Events

1. After your integration is complete, go to **Configure \> Events** in the left navigation.
2. You'll see a list of all available events, initially under the **Blocked** tab.
3. Review the list and click **Import** for any event you want your agents to track and optimize.

Focus especially on:

- **Engagement events** (such as clicks or opens)
- **High-intent events** (like add-to-cart or app-specific actions)
- **Revenue events** (completed purchases, subscriptions, etc.)

<Info>
  Each event includes a 30-day summary showing how often it occurred and how many users performed it. Click the chart icon under **# Event Tracking** to view trends over time.

### Step 2: Classify Your Events

Once imported, use the dropdown next to each event to assign it a classification. Classifications tell your agents which actions are most important for learning and optimization.

You can choose from the following classifications:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Click">
    Low-friction engagement actions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intent">
    Actions that show strong purchase
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revenue">
    Final conversion events tied to value
  </Card>
  <Card title="General Engagement">
    Broader engagement signals
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
