To help your agents learn what matters most to your business, you'll need to identify and classify your key events.

### Step 1: Import Relevant Events

1. After your integration is complete, go to **Configure \> Events** in the left navigation.
2. You'll see a list of all available events, initially under the **Blocked** tab.
3. Review the list and click **Import** for any event you want your agents to track and optimize.

Focus especially on:

- **Engagement events** (such as clicks or opens)
- **High-intent events** (like add-to-cart or app-specific actions)
- **Revenue events** (completed purchases, subscriptions, etc.)
