Messages in Aampe are **not just simple, one-off notifications**‚Äîthey're dynamic, intelligent, and highly flexible building blocks that your AI agents use to communicate with users across different channels and moments.

Each **Aampe message** consists of **many alternates**, and each alternate is made up of**components**  (like a header, body, image, CTA, etc.). These alternates give our agents options‚Äîso they can choose the **best combination** of content, format, and timing for each user.

A single message in Aampe can easily contain **hundreds or thousands of alternates**, generated from your defined components. This gives the model room to experiment and optimize across audiences, behaviors, and outcomes.
