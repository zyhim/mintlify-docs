## What Are Triggers?

In Aampe, triggers act as eligibility signals—they tell our AI agents which users could potentially receive a message, based on actions those users have taken. But unlike traditional systems where a trigger might immediately send a message, our agentic AI takes a more strategic approach.\\n\\nOnce a user qualifies for a trigger, the AI agent uses it as a guardrail, not a direct instruction. This allows the agent to decide the right moment to deliver a message within a relevant window, balancing timing, context, and message effectiveness.

## Trigger Types

We support three types of triggers:\\n\\n**1. Aampe Trigger (Optimized Eligibility Window)**\\nThis trigger type functions like a dynamic audience filter based on events. If a user completes a specified event within a set timeframe (e.g., "purchased in the last 7 days"), they become eligible for the message.\\n\\nThe AI agent then determines the best time to send it within that 7-day window, optimizing for maximum impact.\\n\\n**2. Real-Time Trigger**\\nThis is an immediate trigger, so a webhook is used to send the message as soon as the event occurs.\\n\\nIt is useful when the timing of the message is critical—e.g., when confirming a booking, reacting to a major user action, or providing instant feedback.\\n\\n**3. Real-Time with Delay**\\nLike the real-time trigger, this also uses a webhook but allows you to configure a delay, such as sending the message one day after the event.\\n\\nThis is useful when you want to follow up on a real-time action, but not immediately, giving the user some space before messaging.

## Exit Events

Within any trigger, you can define one or more exit events. Users who complete an exit event immediately become ineligible for that trigger and any messages attached to it.\\n\\nThis helps prevent irrelevant messaging, for example, if a user completes a purchase after entering a cart-abandonment trigger, you can set "Purchase Complete" as an exit event to stop further nudges.

## Using Triggers

Triggers let you send messages only after a user completes a specific action, such as making a purchase, completing onboarding, or finishing a level in your app.

This helps you send the right message to the right user at the right time.

<Warning>
  **Don’t Overuse Triggers\!**\
  A common mistake is over-constraining your messages with too many triggers. Triggers limit the pool of messages your agents can choose from.
</Warning>

**Example:**

If you have 500 total messages, but 250 of them require a “purchase complete” trigger, then users who haven’t purchased anything will only see the other 250. That limits your reach and results.

Before adding a trigger to any message, ask yourself:

_“Does this message really need a trigger, or can it go to all users?”_

You might be surprised how many messages work without one\!

## How to Set Up a Trigger

1. Go to **Configure \> Triggers** in the left-hand menu.
2. Click the **\+ Create** button.
3. Select the trigger type. _(If the real-time trigger is greyed out, please contact us to set it up for you.)_
4. Choose an event and an operator to define your condition:

   == — Equals (e.g., Purchase_Complete == 0 means no purchase made)

   \!= — Not equal to

   \> — Greater than (e.g., more than 1 purchase)

   \>= — Greater than or equal to

   \< — Less than

   \<= — Less than or equal to
5. Set a time window for when the event should have occurred.
6. _(Optional)_ Add more conditions using the **\+ Add** button.
7. Set an exit condition _(optional)_:

   By default, users exit once all trigger-linked messages are sent.

   You can also add exit events (e.g., Purchase_Complete \>= 1) to stop the trigger once the user takes that action.
8. Name your trigger and hit **Save**.

## How to Use a Trigger in a Message

1. Open the **Message Composer**.
2. Start a new message or open an existing one.
3. At the top, click the **Trigger** box (it will say **None** if no trigger is set).
4. Select the trigger you created and click **Save**.

## Important Notes About Triggers

**Aampe Optimized Triggers ≠ Guaranteed Delivery**

Even if a user matches a trigger, it doesn’t mean the message will be sent. Your agents choose the best message for that user based on what is most likely to drive conversion.

**That’s a good thing\!**

Users often qualify for multiple messages. We don’t want to over-message them, so your agents pick the highest-impact message at the optimal time.

**Real-time Trigger** and **Real-time with Delay** = **Delivery Guaranteed**

These work like the event triggers you’re familiar with. Once the event occurs, the message is triggered.
