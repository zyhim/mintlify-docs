## What Are Audiences?

Audiences in Aampe define who is eligible to receive a message, based on user attributes. Unlike triggers, which are tied to specific user actions and events, audiences focus on stable or slowly changing characteristics, like language, region, or other data you send to aampe.

Your agents use audiences as one of the starting points to decide which messages to consider for a user but also as guardrails.

Use audiences when you want to:

- Localize content (e.g., only send French messages to French-speaking users)
- Separate messaging by platform (iOS vs Android)
