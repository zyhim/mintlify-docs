## What Are Audiences?

Audiences in Aampe define who is eligible to receive a message, based on user attributes. Unlike triggers, which are tied to specific user actions and events, audiences focus on stable or slowly changing characteristics, like language, region, or other data you send to aampe.

Your agents use audiences as one of the starting points to decide which messages to consider for a user but also as guardrails.

Use audiences when you want to:

- Localize content (e.g., only send French messages to French-speaking users)
- Separate messaging by platform (iOS vs Android)

## How to Create an Audience

### Create a New Audience

1. Go to the Audiences tab in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click the \+ Create Audience button in the top-right corner.
3. Name your audience.
4. Click \+ Add New Filter to define the criteria (e.g., language = fr, platform = iOS).

### Live Audience Size Preview

As you add filters, Aampe will show you the total number of users who match that audience in real time, along with the percentage of your total user base.

### Sample User IDs

You want to cross-check if users you would expect to be in this audience are present? Click on the ellipsis (the three dots) and on "Sample user IDs." This will give you a list of random user IDs.

## Can't Find the Attributes You Need?

When you're just getting started with Aampe, not all user attributes are visible by default in the audience builder. This is intentionalâ€”to keep your experience focused and avoid cluttering filter menus with unnecessary options.

If you're missing an attribute you'd like to use:

- Go to System Setup \> Attributes
- Activate the attributes you want to make available in your filters

Once activated, these attributes will appear in the audience filter dropdowns.

## How to attach audiences to a message

There are two ways to target a specific audience with a message:

### Option 1: Start from the Audience Page

1. On your newly created audience's page, select it from the dropdown.
2. Click the \+ Create Message button at the bottom of the screen.

### Option 2: Assign Audience When Composing a Message

1. Start a new message in the Message Composer.
2. On the setup page, open the Audience dropdown and select your desired audience.

## Audience Best Practices

- **Keep it simple:** Start with broader audiences and refine as needed. Overly specific audiences can limit your reach.
- **Use meaningful names:** Name audiences clearly so their purpose is immediately obvious to anyone on your team.
- **Consider overlap:** Be aware that users can belong to multiple audiences. Design your audiences with this in mind.
- **Review regularly:** As your user base evolves, revisit your audience definitions to ensure they remain relevant.

<Tip>
  For maximum flexibility, consider creating a set of "base" audiences for common segmentation needs (language, platform, etc.) and then more specific audiences for targeted campaigns. This modular approach makes it easier to mix and match audience criteria as needed.
