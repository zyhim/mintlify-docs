Messages in Aampe are **not just simple, one-off notifications**‚Äîthey're dynamic, intelligent, and highly flexible building blocks that your AI agents use to communicate with users across different channels and moments.

Each **Aampe message** consists of **many alternates**, and each alternate is made up of**components**  (like a header, body, image, CTA, etc.). These alternates give our agents options‚Äîso they can choose the **best combination** of content, format, and timing for each user.

A single message in Aampe can easily contain **hundreds or thousands of alternates**, generated from your defined components. This gives the model room to experiment and optimize across audiences, behaviors, and outcomes.

## Supported Channels

Aampe supports **all major messaging channels**, including:

- Push notifications
- SMS
- Email
- WhatsApp

...and we also support what we call **"surfaces"**‚Äîspaces within your app and web experience where messages can appear, such as:

- [App and web UI surfaces](https://aampe-knowledgehub.vercel.app/messages-surfaces/what-is-a-surface)
- In-app messages
- Content cards

## Writing your first message

Writing your first message in Aampe is a piece of cake üç∞ and a fun way to start exploring how our agentic system works.

### 1. Open the Message Editor

Head to [compose.aampe.com](http://compose.aampe.com) and click the `+ Quick Create` button in the top-right corner.

### 2. Choose Your Message Type

From the popup, select the channel you want to create a message for (e.g., **Mobile Push**,**Email** , **SMS**, etc.).

### 3. Write Your Message

Once the editor opens you can either start with your setup (Choosing an audience and adding message details) or you can navigate straight to the content tab and:

- Enter your **Header** and **Body** content
- Add an **Image URL** if applicable
- Add your Deeplink
- You'll see a **preview** update live on the right side of the screen or on the "cover" tab.

<Info>
  **Don't worry‚Äîthis is just Draft Mode\!**

  Your message won't be sent until integrations are set up and you click **"Start Sending"**.
</Info>

The **character count** helps you to identify if some of your alternates are too long to be fully displayed. (Side note: We've found that truncation usually doesn't hurt performance üòâ)

## How to Schedule Messages

Sometimes you'll want a message to go out **only during a specific window**‚Äîlike for a holiday promotion, a product launch, or a time-sensitive campaign.

While Aampe's agentic model thrives on having a rich catalog of messages to choose from,**scheduled messages**  give you extra control when content is only relevant during a particular date range.

![Scheduling Options Web](/images/scheduling_options.webp)

### Steps to Schedule a Message

1. **Write your message**¬†as you normally would in the Message Composer.
2. Go to the¬†`Scheduling tab`¬†in the editor.
3. Choose your schedule.
   1. By default,¬†**"Delegate to agents"**¬†is set. Your agents will find the right time, day and frequency.
   2. If you have¬†**messages that should be send during a certain time**, for example Christmas messages should be part of our agent's selection only in December. Or breakfast themed messages should only be sent during morning hours.
   3. **One-time-send**\
      If you have a message that should be sent only once, like a monthly newsletter, your can use this scheduling functionality. Be aware, that these messages are excluded from learnings for your agents.
4. When you're ready, you can review everything and hit`Start Sending`¬†to activate the message.

Once the scheduled window ends, the message will automatically be moved to your **Expired**folder. It will no longer be eligible for delivery.

### A Few Important Notes

<Card title="Scheduling sets eligibility, not a send time">
  Your agents will still choose the **best time** to send the message within your defined window, based on each user's behavior and context.
</Card>

<Card title="Not all users will receive all messages">
  Just because a message is live and a user is eligible doesn't guarantee delivery. Your agents select the message most likely to drive your defined goal for that user.
</Card>

<Card title="Need 100% delivery?">
  If the message must reach every user in an audience, consider using a **One time send**, which bypasses agentic optimization and ensures delivery.
</Card>

## Setting Messaging Frequency

Aampe is designed to avoid spamming your users. Your agents are trained to send fewer, smarter messages that actually drive results. In fact, most customers find that Aampe delivers better performance while sending significantly fewer messages overall.

Before any message is sent, your agents assess whether it will meaningfully increase the probability of a user taking the desired action. If the answer is no, the message is not sent.

That said, we know that some teams need to enforce additional guardrails. To support that, Aampe allows you to define **frequency limits** for how many messages users can receive in a given week.

### How to Set Messaging Frequency

1. Go to **Configure \> Frequency Limits** in the left-side navigation
2. Click **Edit** next to any trigger
3. Set the **maximum number of messages per week** for that trigger
4. Click **Save**

> Your changes will take effect the following day.

### How Frequency Limits Work

Frequency limits are defined **per trigger**. This gives you granular control over messaging volume based on user behavior.

- If a user has **not qualified** for any trigger, only the \*\*"No Trigger"\*\*frequency limit applies.
- If a user has **qualified** for one or more triggers, they may receive:
  - Up to the max number of messages set under **"No Trigger"**
  - Plus, the max number of messages for **each trigger** they qualify for

<Info>
  Example: If you set a "No Trigger" limit of 5 messages per week, and a "Cart Abandonment" trigger limit of 4 messages per week, a user who qualifies for the Cart Abandonment trigger could receive up to 9 messages in total that week.
</Info>

### Keep in Mind

These are **upper bounds**, not quotas. Just because a user could receive that many messages doesn't mean they will.

Your agents still determine the **optimal** messaging frequency for each user, which is often well below the defined maximums‚Äîespecially if higher volumes would not increase the likelihood of conversion.

## Sending a Test Message

Want to test how your message will look and behave on a real device before it goes live? You can easily send a test message directly from the Message Editor.

![Send A Test Message Pn](/images/send_a_test_message.png)

### Steps to Send a Test Message

1. Open your message in the **Message Editor**
2. Click the **Test Icon** located at the bottom of the editor
3. Enter your **device token** in the field provided
4. Click **Send**. You'll see a confirmation, and the message should arrive on your device within a few minutes

### Don't Have Your Device Token?

If you're unsure how to get your device token:

- Click the **"Need help getting this?"** link in the test message window
- This will automatically send a request to our team at [developer@aampe.com](mailto:developer@aampe.com), and we'll assist you directly

### Token Management

Once a message is successfully sent, you can **save your token** for future use, no need to re-enter it each time.
