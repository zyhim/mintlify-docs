## Components

The building blocks of a message

When writing messages, we choose what to say and how to say it, then craft a message accordingly.

We may or may not realize it, but we actually write in parts, then instinctively combine those parts to create a message. These parts or components are usually present in any kind of communication.

Any message usually contains multiple components: greetings, value propositions, product or feature offerings, incentives, calls to action, and so forth.

Now take another look at the same message. Can you identify its different components?

## Why use Components?

Today, if you had to write for 3 unique user personas, you would write 3 entire messages from scratch.

While this isn't a big deal for 3, it's impossible to write at a scale of 10,000\+ unique messages.

That's why on aampe, we break down a message into components, write alternates for each component, and then let the agents mix and match them to create unique combinations that can be sent to users.

Now take another look at the same message. Can you identify its different components?

This allows your agents to continuously test what resonates with a user.

So, what you're writing is not one message, but a group of messages made up of different combinations of alternates. We call these message groups on aampe.

## Tips for Success

- **You don't have to use each component in every message.**

  But as a start, we recommend adding an Offering and a Value Proposition in every message (either at the overall message group level or at an alternate level).
- **Avoid using more than one of each component type per message** (e.g. using a Value Proposition in the Header and another Value Proposition in the Body OR an Offering in the Header and an Offering on the whole message). This impedes your agents' ability to learn fast and cleanly.

  For example, an agent sends a message containing a combination of two Value Propositions, one about Affordability and one about Convenience. Let's say the user responds positively to it.

  Even though the message is a success, agents won't know why it was successful. Did a user respond because the offering was affordable or because it was convenient? We won't know.

## Labels

It's not enough to just send out millions of messages. Agents need to learn from it too. This is where labels come in.

Labels are a way for us to logically and semantically tag content. Even though we learn at an individual level, labels enable us to analyse user behaviour at an aggregate level and categorize the content we write.

Think Netflix or Spotify. Each item in their content inventory is tagged using semantic labels, some of which are quite niche and offbeat. This is what they use to learn about user preferences, likes and dislikes.

Now take another look at the same message. Can you identify its different components?

Similarly, every alternate in your library needs a label. Unless it's labelled, agents won't learn anything from it.

Labels can be applied to an entire message group, or to each alternate. How you apply them depends on the kind of message you write and what you want to learn from it.

Let's look at each component, and dive into creating labels for them.

### **Offering**

**This is an important one\!**

Offerings are the different items or features you offer on your app. You can define offerings by product, sub-products, features, departments, or verticals.

For example, a food & delivery app may list their Offering Labels as:

- Food
- Groceries
- Dine Out
- Liquor

Here's another example of Offerings Labels on a travel app:

- Flights
- Hotels
- Trains
- Bus
- Vacation Rentals

> Look through your app or product, and try to list down your unique offerings. Hint: usually these are the different destinations, tabs or pages on your app.

### <Tooltip tip="">Value Proposition</Tooltip>

**This one is important too\!**

Value Propositions are the reasons why your users care about your products or offerings. They are closely tied to the Offerings component, and can be derived from the initial list you created.

Example of Value Propositions:

| **Value**       | **Description**                                                                 | **Copy Example**                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Convenience     | Making things easy, quick, and hassle-free for users.                           | "Get what you need, when you need it—effortlessly."          |
| Trust           | Ensuring reliability, honesty, and integrity in all interactions.               | "Built on trust, designed for you."                          |
| Personalization | Tailoring products, services, or experiences to individual needs.               | "Tailor-made just for you—because one size doesn't fit all." |
| Affordability   | Ensuring users get value for money with budget-friendly options.                | "Great experiences shouldn't break the bank."                |
| Quality         | Delivering excellence, durability, and high standards in products and services. | "Excellence you can see, feel, and trust."                   |
| Control         | Giving users the ability to manage their experience and outcomes.               | "Take charge—you're in full control of every step."          |

When defining Value Propositions, instead of thinking of it from a product perspective, we strongly encourage you to think about it from a user perspective.

Product-focused value propositions tend to look like this:

_Instant Delivery, Exclusive Deals, Free Cancellation.._

> **Hint: If you can't see the difference between an Offering and a Value Proposition, something's wrong**

We want to go deeper. We want our value propositions (and therefore our content) to reflect core human values that are important to users, so we can build a stronger relationship between users and the brand.

User-focused value propositions are more reflective of why users care about something. They look something like this:

_Speed, Exclusivity, Flexibility..._

Defining user-focused value-based Value Propositions also ensure you can learn about what your user cares about across different Offerings.

For example: Your agent may learn that a user prefers Affordability when it comes to Flights, so they'll start trying content labelled Affordability for Trains, Buses and Hotels as well.

### Incentive

Incentives are how you 'sweeten the deal' to help push your user over the finish line. These are typically things like "10% off\!" or "Free delivery\!"

Examples of Incentive Labels:

| **Incentive**       | **Description**                        | **Copy Examples**                                   |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Percentage Discount | Offers a % off the price.              | "Save 20% on your next order"                       |
| Dollar Discount     | Offers a fixed amount off.             | "Enjoy \$10 off your first purchase"                |
| Free Trial          | Allows users to try before committing. | "Try it free for 30 days—no credit card required\!" |
| Free Delivery       | Eliminates delivery costs.             | "Enjoy free delivery on all orders over \$50\!"     |

### Greeting

A Greeting is how you grab your user's attention. It can be as simple as "Hey there\!" or as specific as "Oh no\! You left something in your cart\!"

Examples of Greeting Labels:

| **Greeting**   | **Description**                               | **Copy Example**                                   |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct         | A widely used, general opener.                | "Hey there\!" "Hi"                                 |
| Curious        | Uses intrigue or a teaser to grab attention.  | "Guess what?" "Did you know?"                      |
| Question-Based | Sparks curiosity by starting with a question. | "Did you know you have a surprise waiting?"        |
| Contextual     | Acknowledges past activity or timing.         | "Welcome back\! Let's pick up where you left off." |
| Celebratory    | Highlights achievements or milestones.        | "Congrats\! You just unlocked something."          |

### Call to Action

Your Call to Action is how you encourage your user to action. It's usually a simple command like "Tap here" or a more urgent CTA like "Get it before it's gone\!"

Examples of Call to Action Labels:

| **Call to action** | **Description**                                    | **Copy Examples**                                          |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transactional      | Directs users to purchase, subscribe, or commit.   | "Subscribe now"                                            |
| Encouraging        | Motivates the user to take action with confidence. | "Get started" "Go for it\!" "Take the next step"           |
| Exploratory        | Encourages browsing or discovery.                  | "Check out our latest features\!" "Explore more" "Dive in" |
| Community          | Invites users to join or engage socially.          | "Join our growing community today\!"                       |
| Reminders          | Follows up on incomplete actions.                  | "Don't forget—complete your setup today\!"                 |

### Tone

Tone represents the different ways in which you can speak to users. Some brands choose to stick to one tone for all their content, whereas others prefer to experiment with different tones for different users or lifecycle stages.

Example of Tone Labels:

| **Tone**     | **Description**                            | **Copy Examples**                                               |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casual       | Relaxed and conversational.                | "Hey\! Thought you'd love this—check it out\!"                  |
| Friendly     | Warm and inviting.                         | "We're so glad you're here\! Let's get started."                |
| Professional | Clear, polished, and business-like.        | "Here's everything you need to know about your account."        |
| Reassuring   | Builds confidence and credibility.         | "Your security is our top priority. Here's how we protect you." |
| Playful      | Lighthearted, fun, and sometimes humorous. | "You \+ this deal = a match made in heaven. ❤"                  |

### Other

The Other component is for adding variation to anything that doesn't fit into any of the other buckets. Most customers use the Other component to do things like experiment with different emojis.
