## Step 1: Define Your Message Goal

Before you start creating your message, it's important to clearly define what you want to achieve. Are you looking to:

- Inform users about a new feature
- Encourage users to complete an action
- Re-engage inactive users
- Gather feedback from your users

Having a clear goal will help you craft a more effective message and make it easier to measure success.

## Step 2: Choose Your Message Structure

Aampe offers several message structures to help you achieve your goals. Select the structure that best fits your needs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Simple Details">
    A straightforward message with text only. Ideal for quick updates or simple notifications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text with Media">
    Combine text with images or videos to create more engaging messages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-step Message">
    Create a sequence of messages to guide users through a process or journey.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interactive Message">
    Include buttons, menus, or other interactive elements to encourage user action.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 3: Craft Your Message Content

Now it's time to write the actual content of your message. Here are some tips for creating effective message content:

- **Be clear and concise:** Keep your message focused and to the point.
- **Use a conversational tone:** Write as if you're speaking directly to your user.
- **Include a clear call to action:** Make it obvious what you want the user to do next.
- **Personalize when possible:** Use user data to make your message more relevant.

<Card title="Example Message" cta="Yes, show me">
  Hi [User Name], We noticed you haven't tried our new feature yet. It helps you [benefit] with just a few clicks. Would you like to give it a try?
</Card>

## Step 4: Apply Labels

Apply appropriate labels to your message to help categorize it and enable your agents to learn from its performance:

- **Content label:** Feature announcement
- **Audience label:** Active users
- **Purpose label:** Feature adoption

## Step 5: Preview and Test

Before sending your message to all users, it's important to preview and test it:

1. Preview your message on different devices to ensure it looks good everywhere
2. Send a test message to yourself or a small team
3. Check all links and interactive elements to make sure they work correctly
4. Review the message for any typos or errors

> ### Pro Tip
>
> Consider A/B testing different versions of your message to see which performs better. This can help you refine your messaging strategy over time.
