Content is at the heart of your messaging strategy—and in Aampe, it works a little differently than what you may be used to.

In this section, you'll get a complete overview of how to:

- Structure your messages using components
- Add meaning to your content with labels
- Rethink your approach to messaging in an agentic, AI-driven system

## What You'll Learn

### Components: Building blocks for dynamic content

Messages in Aampe are made up of components—like headers, bodies, CTAs, and images. These components combine to form thousands of alternates, giving your agents a wide range of personalized options for each user.

### Labels: Teaching your agents what content means

You'll also learn how to tag your content with labels like Offerings, Value Propositions, and Incentives. These help your agents understand what a message is about—and who it's best suited for.

### A new way of thinking about messaging

Traditional messaging is static: you write one version, schedule it, and send it to a list.

Aampe introduces a new model: content becomes modular, adaptive, and continuously optimized. Messages are no longer "one-and-done"—they evolve with your users and your business.

Whether you're new to personalization or transitioning from rule-based CRM systems, this section will give you the foundation you need to create powerful, high-performing content with Aampe.
